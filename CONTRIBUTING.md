# Contributing to ClipRust

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
So all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (will be added soon).
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/milinbhakta/ClipRust/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/milinbhakta/ClipRust/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that there is a bug and how to fix it.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `cargo fmt` to format your code automatically

## License
